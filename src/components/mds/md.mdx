# Methodology
![](./methodology.png)
Overview of our TextCrafter.
TextCrafter consists of three steps:
(a) Instance Fusion: Strengthen the connection between visual text and its corresponding carrier.
(b) Region Insulation: Leverage the positional priors of the pre-trained DiT model to initialize the layout information for each text instance while separating and denoising text prompts across different regions.
(c) Text Focus: Enhance the attention maps of visual text, refing the fidelity of text rendering.
